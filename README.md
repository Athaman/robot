# instructions
The Toy Robot coding challenge is described in the following pages. Please review and complete an implementation that
fulfils the requirements. Please take as much time as you need to complete the challenge. We would prefer you take the
time to complete a solution you are happy with.
We use these submissions to help us understand your abilities and provide a discussion point should you be successful
in progressing to the next stage. We are specifically interested in how you approach the problem in code. We like to see
elegant solutions and clean code. We are not looking for elaborate patterns, architectures that go beyond what is
necessary to solve this problem. Please minimise your use of 3rd party libraries or frameworks to those that offer
convenience only. We are only interested in your skill in solving the problem, not your ability to use a framework.
Please complete the solution in a language relevant for the role being applied for. You will be advised when receiving the
challenge by our hiring manager.
What to include in your submission
● Link to GitHub repository, or zip of source code
● Appropriate documentation such as a readme (it should be clear how to setup and run your app)
● Appropriate unit and/or integration tests included with your source code (these should be runnable)

# Description and requirements:
The application is a simulation of a toy robot moving on a square table top, of dimensions 5 units x 5 units. There are no
other obstructions on the table surface. The robot is free to roam around the surface of the table, but must be prevented
from falling to destruction. Any movement that would result in the robot falling from the table must be prevented,
however further valid movement commands must still be allowed.
Create a console application that can read in commands of the following form -
PLACE X,Y,F
MOVE
LEFT

RIGHT
REPORT
PLACE will put the toy robot on the table in position X,Y and facing NORTH, SOUTH, EAST or WEST. The origin (0,0)
can be considered to be the SOUTH WEST most corner. It is required that the first command to the robot is a PLACE
command, after that, any sequence of commands may be issued, in any order, including another PLACE command. The
application should discard all commands in the sequence until a valid PLACE command has been executed.
MOVE will move the toy robot one unit forward in the direction it is currently facing.
LEFT and RIGHT will rotate the robot 90 degrees in the specified direction without changing the position of the robot.
REPORT will announce the X,Y and F of the robot. This can be in any form, but standard output is sufficient.
A robot that is not on the table can choose to ignore the MOVE, LEFT, RIGHT and REPORT commands.
Input can be from a file, or from standard input, as the developer chooses.
Provide test data to exercise the application.
It is not required to provide any graphical output showing the movement of the toy robot.
The application should handle error states appropriately and be robust to user input.
# Constraints:
The toy robot must not fall off the table during movement. This also includes the initial placement of the toy robot. Any
move that would cause the robot to fall must be ignored.

# Design decisions and assumptions
Scattered throughout the code you will find some comments discussing why I have chosen specific implementation choices but here I would like to call out that I have opted not to utilise existing packages available on NPM to make the project cleaner and prettier simply because I assume the challenge is to write your own code and not utilise projects like Commander, Chalk, and other existing command line utility packages.

Command Pattern? Should we instantiate a table class that knows where the robot(s) is(are) and tracks them plus is responsible for issuing individual robots their commands? Without proper use cases in mind for expansion this feels like over engineering for now and I will stick with the robot being self contained for YAGNI reasons.

The constraint of not falling off the table on Placement isn't very clear on what to do if the direction is invalid, I will assume it counts as 'off the table' if someone faces the robot in anything other than the classic NESW.

# TODOS
Write many more tests, gotta do happy path and fail path for each function and method. Add more edge cases into the user input section in particular, at the moment I'm mostly trusting to an external library to handle that. Could afford to put in a few integration tests as well.
